# Patchouli Books Web Client

I find it really annoying to need an entire Minecraft instance running just to read the documentation for a mod that uses Patchouli. Some mods have a web version but they are often just a wall of text without the elegant rendering of patchouli's in game book. The project aims to change that. Any mod that uses patchouli should be able to instantly create a web version of their documentation from their github repository.
